# MiniLinux
Bare-Minimum Linux System

Inspired by http://www.ericphelps.com/linux/bootdisk/MakeDisk.pdf and [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

Cross-compliation process heavily based on [musl-cross](https://github.com/GregorR/musl-cross/)

The absolute bare-minimum required for a booting and "functional" system
